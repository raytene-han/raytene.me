      <p id="aboutparagraph">Hi, I'm Raytene, a structural engineer pivoting into software engineering. At UC San Diego, I studied structural engineering and was exposed to basic programming
        using MatLab and OpenSees. While I had enjoyed the little programming in the school curriculum, I stayed the course and graduated with a degree in structural engineering. I went
        on to work at a structural engineering firm in LA for four years. Over the last four years, I worked on dozens of buildings, got my professional engineering license, and actually
        dabbled a bit in visual programming. My efforts were part of my firm's Advanced Tech initiative to automate design processes, where I reaffirmed my enjoyment of programming.
        <br>
        <br>
        As I entered my fourth year in the structural engineering profession, I began to reevaluate my career and where I wanted to be in the next few years.
        Software engineering came to mind, so I quit my job and applied to Rithm School to officially begin my transition to becoming a fullstack engineer. So far, I've participated in
        a few free workshops and learned some JavaScript fundamentals, designed a simple webpage (you're looking at it!) with HTML and CSS, and built a card-based memory game.
        I'm ecstatic for this next chapter in my career and am eager to see what else I can create. Stay tuned for more from me!
